# musicsync

It's an app that I'm making mostly for educational purposes, but it would be quite useful for myself if it happens to work.

I'd like it to be able to:
- ask spotify web API for list of songs in my playlists
- store all the songs in a database on my pc
- compare my local music files with the database and log which songs are missing.
